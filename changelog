June 7, 2021 - LARGE MISTAKE Edition
----------------------------
- I HAD THE REWARD ARRAYS THE WRONG WAY AROUND SO S RANK WAS D RANK AND SO ON AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
- Anyways I also moved the "WW Table" from Story to ItEx and made it the "ItEx Table" since that one still has old EP
- Also fixed Skip Ticket amount not showing on ItEx calc if it's more than 0

----------------------------
- KLAB WW TEAM JUST CAN'T KEEP THEMSELVES FROM FUCKING UP ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING!
- SO THE KLAB WARNING IS BACK! FUCK YOU KLAB WW TEAM!
- On the brighter side, re-implementing the Klab warning made me find a bug:
- Fixed a bug when saving configuration on the Exchange Calc while the Target Type is set to Item Amount

July 23, 2020 - Bond Boarding Edition
----------------------------
- Added Bond Board bonus things to SP Power Calculator
- Thanks to ShinyLatias and Rev on LLcord for the help <3
- Input side is getting pretty crammed though
- Also fixed setting the song attribute to "None" assuming that every unit matches attribute... oops

July 15, 2020 - ...Are You Sure? Edition
----------------------------
- Removed Klab warning
- I'm still extremely pissed because they have not apologized at all, and tried to cover it up with cheap sales...
- But apparently all the big players are back throwing money at the game?
- So I guess they're happy with Klab WW Team finally doing the bare minimum, I don't play WW so away it goes
- But Worldwide calculation now uses the new LP limits as well, there you go

June 22, 2020 - Gimmicky Edition
----------------------------
- SP Power Calculator can now deal with song gimmicks
- Also added an explanation to the SP Power Calculator

June 21, 2020 - Fuck Klab WW, Unironically Edition
----------------------------
- Okay I kind of really hate soapboxing on a tool website but Klab WW Team is making it real hard lol
- Added the "Klab warning" if using the calc on the WW region to spread awareness of their bullshit

May 12, 2020 - Omegawhale Edition
----------------------------
- Hi there! Another quick fix and another short changelog entry again
- Fixed a problem with the average LP bar size calculation when starting at the max rank (200)

April 22, 2020 - False Assumptions Edition
----------------------------
- Hello friends! I'm trying to finish a 4koma translation RIGHT NOW but an error popped up so here's a quick fix
- Fixed Loveca Stars giving the wrong LP amount (I assumed they still gave a full bar, but it's a fixed 100 LP now)

March 19, 2020 - Stay Healthy Edition
----------------------------
- Hello, everyone! I'm currently doing absolutely nothing except ruining my sleep schedule because all my exams were canceled.
- Anyways here's what I'm doing while practicing some social distancing:
- Washed my hands before writing this update
- Added the new JP server LP maximum
- Made the Region select for the Automatic Timer a general region select
    - This will allow you to simulataneously change the automatic timer, event point tables and LP caps at once
- Changed 50%/100% LP candies to 50/100 LP candies
- Removed WW point table override because Klab WW Team will surely use the new point tables from now... right?

March 5, 2020 - More Small Oopsies Edition
----------------------------
- What's up, everyone? I ruined a 10 hour 3D print today because I'm too dumb to enter a command correctly.

- Fixed the Exchange Event calculator being messed up because of the bug fix from yesterday night

March 4, 2020 - It's The Small Oopsies That Hurt Edition
----------------------------
- Hi everyone! I finally got around to play the new Layton game. I still like that series a lot.
- Anyways here's what I'm doing while I can't figure out yet another puzzle text:
- Fixed Booster Item bonus applying to the unit bonus
- That means I can't just reverse the Git commits once the WW event is over... meh

March 3, 2020 - I Take Back Everything Nice I Ever Said About The Klab WW Team Edition
----------------------------
- Why
- Why Why Why
- WW Event uses not only the old event point table, but the OLD STORY SONG EVENT POINT TABLE
- THERE IS NO BONUS FOR PLAYING ON HIGHER DIFFICULTIES
- THEY DIDN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT LP REGEN ON THAT EVENT USED TO BE 3 MINUTES, NOT 4 MINUTES
- WW PLAYERS ARE ONLY MAKING ~70% OF THE EVENT POINTS THAT THE JP MADE IN THIS EVENT
- AND OF COURSE THE POINT REWARD TARGETS ARE THE SAME!!!!!!!
- Anyways, well, the calculator now uses that point table if on the WW region. I look forward to reversing this change.
- At least, I hope I will be allowed to, but you never know with Klab WW Team.

February 26, 2020 - Ai Can't Believe They Translated The Puns So Well Edition
----------------------------
- Hi everyone! I just got my first S rank on a Hard+ (Braveheart Coaster), and now I'm using 2000 skip tickets on it.
- Anyways here's what I'm doing while tapping the Restore LP button several times:
- SIFAS WW is finally out, and so is the Region Selection button
- Shoutout to Klab for using new LP values from the start so I don't have to do dumb hacks <3
- I'm just hoping that means they also use the new EP tables or things are going to go whack
- Do you think they'll change points for the rewards or is that going to be weird :thinking:

February 6, 2020 - Watching A 3D Print Edition
----------------------------
- Hello again, everyone. I am currently watching a calibration print on my new 3D printer. It's fun.

- Added selection of target type to the Exchange Event calculator, so you can go for a certain amount of items
- Fixed "less than a minute" showing when losing 0 LP to sleep
- Fixed numbers of large results not shrinking on page load
- Doubled result display animation speed

February 4, 2020 - Go To Jail For Root Crimes Edition
----------------------------
- How's everyone doing? I'm blocked out of SIFAS because my phone is rooted. Thanks Klab
- Maybe partially my fault because I was still running SuperSU instead of Magisk LMAO
- Anyways here's what I'm doing with my free time:
- Added Exchange Event calculator (which is just the Story Event one copypasted with some fields removed)
- Fixed "-1 EXP" showing if you enter a current player rank higher than the current max player rank
- Changed label from "Current Rank" to "Current Player Rank" to avoid confusion with the event rank

----------------------------
- Final rank result now shows amount of EXP in that rank. Maybe you're close to another rank up?

September 29, 2019 - Event Guessing Edition
---------------------------
- Event Announcement is out
- From what I can tell, it should a lot like "normal" events from other games: play any lives to get points, but put
  certain units into your team to get an event point boost
- The calculator has been changed according to those assumptions, let's hope it's mostly correct
- If so, all I will need to do is plug in the correct event point rewards
- Also, added link to the LLSIF calc

September 27, 2019 - Here We Go Again Edition
---------------------------
- Cloned the entirety of the SIFAS calc
- BUT WHAT IF IT WAS ORANGE?
- Also what if it had one difficulty less
- Also what if it had no multipliers or combo ranks or LP reduction or EN timer region
- Also what if it had different LP costs, EXP rewards, rank up limits and refill costs
- I mean you get the idea, now let's wait for the first event
- And I added a little icon in the header because why not
