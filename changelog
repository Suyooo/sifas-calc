----------------------------
- Final rank result now shows amount of EXP in that rank. Maybe you're close to another rank up?

September 29, 2019 - Event Guessing Edition
---------------------------
- Event Announcement is out
- From what I can tell, it should a lot like "normal" events from other games: play any lives to get points, but put
  certain units into your team to get an event point boost
- The calculator has been changed according to those assumptions, let's hope it's mostly correct
- If so, all I will need to do is plug in the correct event point rewards
- Also, added link to the LLSIF calc

September 27, 2019 - Here We Go Again Edition
---------------------------

- BUT WHAT IF IT WAS ORANGE?
- Also what if it had one difficulty less
- Also what if it had no multipliers or combo ranks or LP reduction or EN timer region
- Also what if it had different LP costs, EXP rewards, rank up limits and refill costs

- And I added a little icon in the header because why not
