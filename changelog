October 4, 2019 - Confirmation Edition
----------------------------
- The event point table is now 100% confirmed
- A thank you to the brave people who sacrificed their LP for science: Reikyu, Luna and Aqudalan
- Also a minute of silence for my LP who were sacrificed for B and C ranks across the board
- Now I can actually play the video game

October 3, 2019 - RED ALERT WE HAVE AN EVENT Edition
----------------------------
- Guesstimated values are in
- Turns out the Bonus button doesn't show *your* bonus, so tooltip is changed
- Added SP Power Calculator

October 2, 2019 - Health Is Important Edition
----------------------------
- Added a sleep warning because I'm honestly concerned
- Also uploading it a little bit before event start so search engines can find it

October 1, 2019 - I'm Skipping This Edition Edition
----------------------------
- Calculator now knows about the existence of skip tickets, and will add them if there's not enough time left to play

September 30, 2019 - Just Killing Time Until SIFAS Event Edition
----------------------------
- Final rank result now shows amount of EXP in that rank. Maybe you're close to another rank up?

September 29, 2019 - Event Guessing Edition
---------------------------
- Event Announcement is out
- From what I can tell, it should a lot like "normal" events from other games: play any lives to get points, but put
  certain units into your team to get an event point boost
- The calculator has been changed according to those assumptions, let's hope it's mostly correct
- If so, all I will need to do is plug in the correct event point rewards
- Also, added link to the LLSIF calc

September 27, 2019 - Here We Go Again Edition
---------------------------
- Cloned the entirety of the SIFAS calc
- BUT WHAT IF IT WAS ORANGE?
- Also what if it had one difficulty less
- Also what if it had no multipliers or combo ranks or LP reduction or EN timer region
- Also what if it had different LP costs, EXP rewards, rank up limits and refill costs
- I mean you get the idea, now let's wait for the first event
- And I added a little icon in the header because why not
