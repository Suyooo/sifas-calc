February 26, 2020 - Ai Can't Believe They Translated The Puns So Well Edition
----------------------------
- Hi everyone! I just got my first S rank on a Hard+ (Braveheart Coaster), and now I'm using 2000 skip tickets on it.
- Anyways here's what I'm doing while tapping the Restore LP button several times:
- SIFAS WW is finally out, and so is the Region Selection button
- Shoutout to Klab for using new LP values from the start so I don't have to do dumb hacks <3
- I'm just hoping that means they also use the new EP tables or things are going to go whack
- Do you think they'll change points for the rewards or is that going to be weird :thinking:

February 6, 2020 - Watching A 3D Print Edition

February 4, 2020 - Go To Jail For Root Crimes Edition
----------------------------
- How's everyone doing? I'm blocked out of SIFAS because my phone is rooted. Thanks Klab
- Maybe partially my fault because I was still running SuperSU instead of Magisk LMAO
- Anyways here's what I'm doing with my free time:
- Added Exchange Event calculator (which is just the Story Event one copypasted with some fields removed)
- Fixed "-1 EXP" showing if you enter a current player rank higher than the current max player rank
- Changed label from "Current Rank" to "Current Player Rank" to avoid confusion with the event rank

September 29, 2019 - Event Guessing Edition
---------------------------
- Event Announcement is out
- From what I can tell, it should a lot like "normal" events from other games: play any lives to get points, but put
  certain units into your team to get an event point boost
- The calculator has been changed according to those assumptions, let's hope it's mostly correct
- If so, all I will need to do is plug in the correct event point rewards
- Also, added link to the LLSIF calc

September 27, 2019 - Here We Go Again Edition
---------------------------
- Cloned the entirety of the SIFAS calc
- BUT WHAT IF IT WAS ORANGE?
- Also what if it had one difficulty less
- Also what if it had no multipliers or combo ranks or LP reduction or EN timer region
- Also what if it had different LP costs, EXP rewards, rank up limits and refill costs
- I mean you get the idea, now let's wait for the first event
- And I added a little icon in the header because why not
