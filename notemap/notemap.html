                    This page attempts to give an as-complete-as-possible collection of song information. This is done
                    by using note map data, which is downloaded from the server when playing a song in the game, in
                    addition to the usual information from the app database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the note map data, it is possible to show a full timeline of the song, including note counts,
                    the positions of notes and which gimmicks they are associated with, the amount of notes in an Appeal
                    Chance to see what voltage or skill/crit chances are required, and the rewards and penalties for
                    clearing or failing them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since note map data is only available when the song is played in game and requires network traffic
                    to be captured, this is a lot of manual work. It might be possible that some songs will be missing
                    for a while until I can unlock them (or just until I stop forgetting to dump them).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there's any note map that is missing, or one you desperately want to see, feel free to contact me
                    and I'll add it as soon as possible. If you have any ideas for more features, I'd love to hear them,
                    too! You can find Twitter/Discord/GitHub in the sidenav menu on the main Calc page.
                </p>
                <b>Here's some neat stuff you can do on this page:</b>
                <ul class="browser-default">
                    <li>
                        Hover over or tap a note gimmick or AC on the timeline to get a popup with the associated
                        detail information. (It's the same information as the panels below, but without having to scroll
                        down.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Click or tap on a Note Gimmick panel to highlight only that gimmick, moving the markers closer
                        to the timeline and fading out others. Click/tap again to unhide. Good for Adv+ notemaps with
                        tons of gimmick notes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Desktop only for now: Hold and drag on the timeline to measure the amount of notes between any
                        two points. You can use this, for example, to measure how many notes are between two ACs to see
                        whether there is enough for you to re-charge your SP skill.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <b>Future Plans:</b>
                <ul class="browser-default">
                    <li>
                        Slowly start dumping Beginner and Intermediate note maps between events (for the sake of
                        completeness).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once Klab releases the new compressed Story chapters with less Lives, start dumping those, so it
                        is possible to find Story Lives that might be good alternatives to the Free Live for Voltage
                        Rankings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Somehow get my hands on the Love U my friends note map, which is the only one missing for the
                        DLP page, but is not available in Free Live and I've already cleared the DLP stage so I can't
                        play it again... (if you have that stage unlocked, but still uncleared when DLP comes around
                        next time, please let me know, maybe we can make something work!)
